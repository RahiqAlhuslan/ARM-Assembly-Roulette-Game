Interactive roulette game implemented in ARMv7 Assembly
Language on the DE1-SoC platform. The game simulates a spinning roulette wheel using ten LEDs that
illuminate sequentially. Players place bets by selecting one of ten switches (SW0-SW9) before gameplay
begins. The LED sequence cycles continuously until the player presses KEY0 to stop the wheel. The final
illuminated LED determines the game outcomeâ€”if it matches the player's chosen switch, "YES" displays
on the 7-segment displays; otherwise, "END" appears. The corresponding LED number (0-9) is shown on
the HEX3 display. This project demonstrates key embedded systems programming concepts including
memory-mapped I/O, bit-level operations, and direct hardware control.
